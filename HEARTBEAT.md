## Check-in
- Has Twan logged workouts or nutrition this week?
- If not: send a gentle, motivating check-in (not pushy)

## Memory Maintenance
- Read today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — is it up to date?
- If daily memory file doesn't exist, create it with session highlights
- If it's Sunday: consolidate weekly daily files into MEMORY.md

## Health Context
- Check `/home/ubuntu/shared/TWAN.md` for any relevant updates
- Note any patterns in workout frequency or weight trends
